1289367_18;[rvollmar 3/27/07] There are two bugs that are causing backwards compatibility issues, and I think the emails we've been exchanging have confused them.;neutral
1326110_2;First, an attempt is made to convert       * each argument.;neutral
132669_3;It is better to express such things in Java, or in a query language that is designed for that.;neutral
132669_4;Why would I want to use XML, when i can use the QBC API, or HQL (HQL can be embedded in the XML, remember), to express this stuff much more naturally?;neutral
132669_5;"In addition, in the longterm we will all most likely be using annotations, and the ""fetch group"" notion does *not* work with annotations.";neutral
1328594_8;It's generally pretty straightforward, but extensibility is not quite clear.;neutral
1342186_2;I have changed one test to see what will happend if I set the pwdIdle to b > 0, and the test passes.;neutral
1342186_3;What exactly is your configuration ?;neutral
1342658_2;The more I think about the issue, the more I find it critical.;neutral
1342658_3;If we remove an entry while someone is doing a search, the search will fail.;neutral
1342658_4;Also we have some problem during replication, just when we try to replicate some deletion, and it might prefectly explain why we get those issues.;neutral
1345883_3;(Ok, as expected ...)  Waiting for a better log, when you will have installed a new server build from 1.0-trunks, then.;neutral
1345883_4;What you can do is trying this request with a different browser when the server is suppose to hang, and also try to do another request when the serveur is supposed to be hang to see if it's not a pb with the PDU length ( what I suspect is that when trying to decode this request, the decoder is waiting for more bytes so wait ad vitam aeternam ...) I gonna try to implement the decoding of this PDU as a test case just to check.;neutral
1346179_3;The search result entry requests does not return the correct DN, because it use the internal representation (byte[]) instead of using the user provided value, which contains escaped values.;neutral
1346179_4;Here, we have two options : 1) work with the internal value, but escape all the special chars 2) work with the stored UP value.;neutral
1346179_5;I think the bnest solution is (2), because the UP value is supposed to be valid - it has successfully been parsed when the first request arrived -.;neutral
1346179_6;This will impact two parts : - searchResultEntry - all the response that contains a LdapResult and which returns a MatchedDN.;neutral
1346179_7;I already have a fix for the first request, but the question is : which version will integrate this modification ?;neutral
1346179_8;any suggestion ?;neutral
1348495_2;I just applied the patch, ran tests.;neutral

1398734_8;During the 10.5.1.1 test cycle this test took about 5 mins (and passed).;neutral

1399944_7;I think I prefer this approach.;neutral
1411398_1;I remember that rule for line breaking in Japanese was very different from that of English.;neutral
1411398_2;In English sentence there exists space between words and that space tells where the line can be breaked.;neutral
1411398_3;However, Japanese sentence does not have such a useful space between words.;neutral

1191390_3;1;neutral
1191390_4;FileSystemView is the user file system view so it can have canDelete() and canRead() methods ..... this is fine.;neutral
1191390_5;2;neutral
1191390_6;FileSystemView can have user object to indicate whose file system view it is representing.;neutral
1191390_7;3;neutral
1191390_8;In that case, caching will be at the FileSystemView level (not at FileObject level).;neutral
1191390_9;Logically this is also fine.;neutral
1191390_10;NativeFileSystemView represents the underlying OS file system view - no more no less.;neutral
1191390_11;Caching is a specialized function.;neutral
1191390_12;So if necessary we can add another FileSystemManager implementation which will support caching.;neutral
1191390_13;But it may not be appropriate to add this in NativeFileSystem classes.;neutral

1423534_1;Hi Suran,  The new catalogs_b.patch looks very good.;positive
1423534_2;It will need another round or two of adjusting but it is definitely looking solid.;neutral
1423534_3;I have applied the patch and am running regression tests now.;neutral
1423534_4;I will post my results when the tests finish.;neutral
1423534_5;I have some comments on the new patch:  PermDescriptor  o You should remove the permUUID field from this class since it shadows the oid field in the superclass.;neutral
1423534_6;In my experience, this kind of shadowing always causes bugs in the future because it is so easy to lose track of which copy of the redundant field is being used.;neutral
1423534_7;"So the constructor for this class should call setUUID( permUUID ) rather than stuffing the shadowing field via ""this.permUUID = permUUID"".";neutral
1423534_8;o Once you do that, you can get rid of the getUUID(), setUUID(), and getObjectID() methods in this class.;neutral
1423534_9;o I have reservations about the second constructor for this class (the one which is used to create a key descriptor rather than a full-fledged permissions descriptor).;neutral
1423534_10;However, I see that you are following the data dictionary patterns for the other permissions descriptors.;neutral
1423534_11;I think you are right to follow the existing patterns.;neutral
1423534_12;But we should put a sticky note on our brains to remind ourselves to clean up this pattern in the future--partially initialized data is brittle.;neutral
1423534_13;This is something we can revisit when we collapse all of the permissions catalogs into the master catalog which you are creating.;neutral
1423534_14;Don't worry, that's another project and not part of the sequence generator work.;neutral
1423534_15;SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory  o I think that you should flip the order of the keys in the second index.;neutral
1423534_16;That is, the key order should be ( schemaID, sequenceName ) rather than ( sequenceName, schemaID ).;neutral
1423534_17;This will speed up the check in DataDictionaryImpl.isSchemaEmpty().;neutral
1423534_18;But maybe you have a use for an index with key order ( sequenceName, schemaID ) which I'm not seeing.;neutral
1423534_19;If so, then I would recommend adding a third index.;neutral
1423534_20;Note that if you swap the key order, then you will need to make a corresponding change to DataDictionaryImpl.getSequenceDescriptor(String, SchemaDescriptor)   o I think that buildColumnList() should return an array of 10 column descriptors, one for each column in the table.;neutral
1423534_21;See, for instance, the corresponding method in SYSALIASESRowFactory.;neutral
1423534_22;SYSROLESRowFactory  o As with SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory, I think that buildColumnList() should return a larger array, one cell for each column in the table.;neutral

1423534_24;EmptyDictionary  o I think that you can remove the stub for dropSequenceDescriptor(String, TransactionController) because you have removed this method from the DataDictionary interface.;neutral
1423534_25;DataDictionaryImpl  o The header comments on getUncachedPermDescriptor() getPermDescriptor(), and dropAllPermDescriptors() look like they were copied from pre-existing methods, so they should be revised to describe the new methods.;neutral

480162_2;Many CID mappings are expressed as ranges, which the code explodes into individual Integer->String pairs.;neutral
480162_3;This causes pretty big data structures as many of our CMaps cover 65k possible mappings!;neutral

766227_1;Patch applied in trunk.;neutral
766227_2;I have added some buttons to help put variables and patterns.;neutral
766227_3;Thank you for your contribution.;neutral
1633444_1;applies to trunk, too;neutral
1114706_2;"Also #3 seems to be fairly simple with a single ""around"" advice in aspectj and a couple of lines for ajc target in build.xml.";neutral
1114706_3;Why use an ad-hoc script that's known (according Erik himself) to have false positive that require manual inspection (which is also not part of the version controlled source tree), when you we have a built-in (aspectj*.jars are already included as build/runtime dependencies) tool specifically for such tasks?;neutral
1114706_4;You can do this for info messages too for more performance when that is off.;neutral
1114706_5;"There are no extra lines of code or maintenance; it is the simplest solution.";neutral
1114706_6;"As long as the change is applied at build time, I don't see any real drawback.  ";neutral
360149_1;Ah, ok ... thanks for the heads up.;neutral
360149_2;"There's a note on the main page about these scripts, but you're right: nothing obvious in some of hte ""sub pages""  I'll take a stab at clarifying.";neutral
1427702_1;Changes to the test look good, and your method for finding which are right/wrong is correct.;neutral
1427702_2;I would advise that a good thing to do once you have fixed this issue is to then perform a similar test modification for setting a valid value and using batching.;neutral
1673444_1;I've started to work towards support for visualising services and cascading configuration.;neutral
1673444_2;The changes in this patch aren't a complete solution but they're free-standing give basic service visualisation and shared configuration support.;neutral
1673444_3;I've introduced a decorator framework for relationships so we can draw the service triangles (or package names).;neutral
1673444_4;The service handling will need to be updated slightly once we're not working from the DummyInfoProvider.;neutral
1673444_5;Handling of services which aren't consumed and services which are consumed by multiple bundles is pretty weak.;neutral
1673444_6;I've also started to add cascading configuration.;neutral
1673444_7;I've added a Theme class and a ComponentAppearance class which takes defaults from the theme and allows them to be over-ridden.;neutral
1673444_8;ComponentAppearances will also inherit from one another when we have nested components (like a bundle inside an application).;neutral
1673444_9;I've only switched the ComponentColorElement (which was the ComponentColorProperty) over to use the new configuration so far, but I'll switch the other elements over to using the new configuration next.;neutral
1673444_10;In the new version, elements have two methods - render(), which draws them, and apply() which  initialises shared properties like colour.;neutral
1673444_11;This allows for a two-phase rendering.;neutral
1673444_12;Apply isn't the best name but we're already using update(), so suggestions welcome.;neutral
1673444_13;:)  I've renamed ComponentColorProperty to be ComponentColorElement and RelationshipAggregation to TwistieAggregation.;positive
1673444_14;I've also moved RelationshipElement to the elements namespace.;neutral
1673444_15;These are all svn file deletions which will need to be done by hand when applying the hand.;neutral

1814664_1;A potentially legitimate use case of a {{set}} without an {{apply}} is a builder class that should not be accessed until the building is complete, at which point the internal state will be accessed directly to produce the final result of some type.;neutral
1814664_2;Such a class does not really need an {{apply}} method.;neutral
1814664_3;However, as a tactical decision imposed by the implementation of the typechecker, we will require a matching {{apply}} method for every {{set}} method, and will reassess this issue later in the context of a possible typechecker redesign.;neutral

533296_1;Jacopo,  Thanks for diving in a pointing Scott at the appropriate screens.;neutral
533296_2;David,  I completely agree that providing more intelligence in the PO creation process would be very helpful, especially for larger businesses.;neutral
533296_3;I can just about cope with the amount of manual intervention required, but in the not too distant future I can see the need for some of the rules you suggest.;neutral
533296_4;The idea of consolidating POs (or SOs, I guess) came mainly because I end up having multiple small POs for some of my suppliers.;neutral
533296_5;However, I also run into the opposite problem.;neutral
533296_6;For my larger suppliers, I will often have a 100 or more requirements built up.;neutral
533296_7;"Since the ""Approved Requirements"" screen paginates the requirements, I'll end up generating multiple orders for the same (large) supplier, simply because the application operates a page at a time.";neutral
533296_8;This annoys my suppliers a bit.;neutral
533296_9;"I guess the obvious thing to do is to go in and reconfigure the pagination so it doesn't (paginate), but if we had the ability to add items to existing POs then you could still use the pagination mechanism and build up the PO page-by-page (quite handy if your working through  your POs during less busy times of the day).

1453891_2;In any case, the code for the toBytes method is written now, so it should be a simple thing to move it to the PType implementation classes.;neutral
1453891_3;It would probably also be worth having optimized versions for primitive values, instead of writing them to an Avro/Writable first to get the bytes representation.;neutral

2113606_2;One of the things I changed in jnr-posix, was to make stat and fstat use stati64 and fstati64 respectively, instead of stat64 and fstat - the last may be why its breaking with jna-posix.;neutral
2113606_3;Look in WindowsLibCFunctionMapper.java for the fstat mapping - it may all magically work if you change fstat to map to _fstat64 (note: no 'i' in the name - uses stat64 struct instead of stati64 ... they have different sized atime, ctime, mtime fields).;neutral
2113606_4;"Otherwise, the WindowsFileStat structure looks ok, apart from the st_blocks and st_blksize fields at the end, which are not part of the windows stat64 struct, so will probably be filled with either zero, or garbage.  ";neutral

1020899_4;If regionnames were made of tablename+endrow instead of tablename+startrow, then in the metatables, doing a search for the region that contains the wanted row, we'd just have to open a scanner using passed row and the first row found by the scan would be that of the region we need (If offlined parent, we'd have to scan to the next row).;neutral
1020899_5;If we redid the meta tables in this format, we'd be using an access that is natural to hbase, a scan as opposed to the perverse, expensive getClosestRowBefore we currently have that has to walk backward in meta finding a containing region.;neutral
1020899_6;This issue is about changing the way we name regions.;neutral
1020899_7;If we were using scans, prewarming client cache would be near costless (as opposed to what we'll currently have to do which is first a getClosestRowBefore and then a scan from the closestrowbefore forward).;neutral
1020899_8;Converting to the new method, we'd have to run a migration on startup changing the content in meta.;neutral

1020899_10;"HBASE-2531 ""32-bit encoding of regionnames waaaaaaayyyyy too susceptible to hash clashes"" proposes changing the randomid so that it contains actual name of the directory in the filesystem that hosts the region.";neutral
1020899_11;If we had this in place, I think it would help with the migration to this new way of doing the meta because as is, the region name in fs is a hash of regionname... changing the format of the regionname would mean we generate a different hash... so we'd need hbase-2531 to be in place before we could do this change.;neutral

1116600_2;I don't see a direct relation between this issue and the issue of simplifying the implementation of efficient map-side joins (MAPREDUCE-1183, more or less).;neutral
1116600_3;Am I missing the connection, or is this a distinct issue?;neutral
1116600_4;File formats are forever.;neutral
1116600_5;More variations add significant, long-term compatibility burdens to the project.;neutral
1116600_6;We badly need to add support for a higher-level object serialization system than Writable.;neutral
1116600_7;But I'm not convinced its wise to add such support to the exisiting Java-only container file formats.;neutral
1116600_8;So I'm all for a more generic serialization API that can be used by MapReduce applications.;neutral
1116600_9;I don't however see that it follows that we should provide implementations of file formats with a large number of different serialization systems, as that invites multiplicative long-term support issues.;neutral
1116600_10;I'd prefer that we instead direct users towards a single preferred high-level serialization system and a single preferred container.;neutral
1116600_11;Historically that's been Writable and SequenceFile.;neutral
1116600_12;We now need to migrate from these to a more expressive, language-independent serialization system and container file.;neutral
1116600_13;Our APIs should be of course be general enough that it's possible to incorporate different serialization systems and different file formats, but we needn't provide implementations of all combinations of these, but should rather direct folks towards a primary implementation.;neutral
1116600_14;Google benefits tremendously by having a single standard serialization system and container file format.;neutral
1116600_15;The Dremel paper (http://sergey.melnix.com/pub/melnik_VLDB10.pdf) argues that this is an essential enabler of their wide variety of interoperable systems.;neutral
1116600_16;The further we depart from this the harder we make it to build systems like Dremel that multiply the utility of stored data.;neutral
1116600_17;Changing serialization systems or file formats is a major imposition for many applications.;neutral
1116600_18;They cannot afford to do it frequently.;neutral
1116600_19;We should provide a clear path forward from Writable+SequenceFile to a new system that's easier to use, less fragile, and language-independent to better facilitate a rich ecosystem of tools.;neutral

367988_1;What is the right process to deprecate this behavior in 3.x?;neutral
367988_2;Is it just a note in the CHANGES.txt?;neutral
367988_3;"We could also try to detect the behavior and log a warning... but i'm not sure that is worth much.  ";neutral

1684034_1;retrospectively setting fix version in preparation for SDO M3;neutral
750378_1;Solution looks as follows: when doing a cluster sync, whether it is for reading or writing, always acquire the version manager's read lock first.;neutral
626262_1;Patch adds javadoc for the newly added tests.;neutral
752306_1;Right, and right after that is the section I was referring to.;neutral
1328775_1;I think the licensing on that one might be complicated.;neutral

477787_1;Hi Andreas,  as we are a bank, we can't provide you with the normal documents as they are internal documents.;neutral

1393433_1;I've attached the output of dblook as db.sql and a simplified creation script as sample.sql that includes the relevant tables and columns with sample data.;neutral
1393433_2;I also verified that the bug still occurs in 10.6.1.0;neutral
1482538_1;Could you supply also a webapp sample?;neutral
1482538_2;It's easy, look in the scratchpad/webapp/mount how it is done.;neutral
1482538_3;This could get many trying it and getting involved.;neutral
1482538_4;If I commit it as-is, we could miss some help.;neutral
1721949_1;Patch to address the issue.;neutral
231637_1;I have found the source of the problem - yet I completely don't understand why such an unrelated thing breaks navigation.;neutral
231637_2;Probably it is way deeper problem.;neutral
231637_4;As soon as I remove wicket enclosure or add some text node inside - the navigation toolbar starts properly counting pages (it was showing 0 of 0 before because it thinks it is not visible in hierarchy).;neutral
1211283_7;"Thanks,  Hari  ";neutral
1513660_1;This has been fixed by check in for CHUKWA-274.;neutral
1377264_1;This patch adds the RelativeTest.java file which is a conversion of the jdbcapi/testRelative test, to the same package as the latter.;neutral

748448_1;"I've modified the patch to name the function rep.normalize  If you think that my proposal is actually not enough ambitious for being called ""normalization"", do you prefer something like rep:toASCII, which may seem less universal ?";neutral
748448_2;I really think there is an added value with this function for Jackrabbit users, I personnally use it with every String-ordered query.;neutral
489104_1;No - unfortunately I do not have enough knowledge to digg into OpenJPA's code;neutral
963946_1;That is correct.;neutral
1355422_1;The build seems to have broken on 10.9 when the test was backported.;neutral
1355422_2;It only breaks if j14lib is not set.;neutral
1355422_3;The problem is that I changed the build script to use java14compile.classpath instead of java15compile.classpath for the new test when I backported it from 10.10.;neutral
1355422_4;I mistakenly thought 10.9 was supposed to work on Java 1.4 (in fact, the 10.9.1 release notes say it is supported, although we removed support for it after 10.8), and the build worked in my environment because I had j14lib set, and the test ran just fine on 1.4.;neutral
1355422_5;I'll post a patch that makes 10.9 compile the test against 1.5 instead of 1.4.;neutral
1355422_6;The patch that broke the build on 10.9, was also backported to 10.8.;neutral
1355422_7;However, on 10.8 it is correct to compile the test against 1.4, so that's not a problem.;neutral

715499_1;The following had serialVersionUID set for the 2.2 release.;neutral
715499_2;There have been no new ones added for 2.3.;neutral

677770_4;"Jason, I suggest you create a separate issue something like ""Integrate BytesRefHash in Realtime Branch"" and I will take care of it.";neutral
677770_5;I think this issue had a clear target to factor out the hash table out of TermsHashPerField and we should close it.;neutral

694863_1;These 3 crashes happen while compiling DocumentWriter.invertDocument.;neutral
694863_2;It must be a bug in Sun's hotspot compiler.;neutral
694863_3;Has anyone opened an issue at http://bugs.sun.com yet?;neutral
694863_4;That method, which inverts a single document, was replaced with new code starting with 2.3, so it's possible you can workaround the bug by upgrading to 2.3 or 2.4.;neutral

1416147_1;And compatibility test also ....;neutral
736254_1;Murray, that is exactly what I am proposing - having a separate org.apache.jspwiki.api -package, and placing a number of existing manager classes into it as interfaces.;neutral
736254_2;"Or to be precise, a mostly equivalent set of APIs; JCR requires some modifications which would make it complicated to support the existing set of APIs - mainly because we need to carry state information in a WikiContext, which the old API signatures do not mostly support.";neutral
736254_3;I would also like us to start using WikiNames wherever useful.;neutral
736254_4;The idea behind this is largely the same as with our existing package structure - there is nothing technical in preventing *everything* to be in the org.apache.jspwiki -namespace (with no subpackages), but both aesthetics and experience tell us that it just makes sense to add subpackages to make class management easier.;neutral
736254_5;In the same vein, isolating the API interfaces into a separate package makes it a lot easier to manage than having everything dispersed around - e.g.;neutral
736254_6;if we want to create a jspwiki-api.jar, we only need to jar up the contents of a particular subdirectory.;neutral
736254_7;If the developer wants to know whether he is using any possibly unstable components, all he needs to do is to glance at the set of import statements on the top - if he's using other classes than org.apache.jspwiki.api.;neutral
736254_8;*, he knows that the classes are potentially unstable.;neutral
736254_9;In addition, it makes the committer's life easier, since there is an agreement by convention that the APIs inside *.api are not to be touched without common agreement, whereas anything outside of this package can be treated with more liberties.;neutral
736254_10;We have so many people contributing in the code that API incompatibilities can creep in without anyone noticing.;neutral
736254_11;"(There is no PageManager at all; there is a ContentManager, which will have a very similar API, but it will manage both pages and attachments.";neutral
1356706_2;What's the purpose of this line in the patch to BaseTestCase, Kristian?;neutral
300300_1;Hi Julien, please have a look on ./test/cpp/TestServer.cpp It's doing exactly what you what to do but TFramedTransport is explicitly specified there.;neutral
1009498_1;It looks like HLog main has support to invoke --split.;neutral
1009498_2;Does it looks like if I call that on the log that it will put split it and put the data into the right place?;neutral
1009498_3;We had a handful of regionservers go OOM yesterday while a MR job was doing heavy writes to a column family that doesn't usually get them.;neutral
1009498_4;In this case, the first OOM occurred here during writing the checksum.;neutral

1403474_1;I agree there's a bug, I just want to ensure any change still works correctly when CURRENT_USER name is passed in.;neutral
1403474_2;My assertion is that the username passed into these routines (without any modification) is equivalent to value of an username identifier in the SQL language after it has been parsed by the SQL engine.;neutral

1571661_1;I couldn't reproduce this.;neutral
1571661_4;Ted, can you reproduce this outside of cassidy.pl?;neutral
1643623_1;Thanks for the response.;neutral
1664747_1;Thanks a lot for sharing that, Josh!;positive
1664747_2;I like the idea of making sure that things that should be specified should be passed as method parameters in one go, rather than through chaining, which makes it a lot harder to see what is required.;neutral
1664747_3;So I took the liberty of updating the patch to use requiredX/optionalX methods like in your code.;neutral
1664747_5;Regarding Doug's points...  > But perhaps the preferred import should instead be 'import static SchemaBuilder.*'?;neutral
1664747_6;The static methods have unique-enough names that this might work well.;neutral

995004_3;I'm thinking of multiple concurrent mutateRows operation, trying to lock the same set of rows.;neutral
995004_4;Perhaps, throwing IOException is going to prevent us from a situation where we end up with a deadlock.;neutral
995004_5;But, we still might want to sort it to ensure (better) progress (no livelock).;neutral
1126952_1;Unless I'm missing something, your patch doesn't actually change how the version is checked, only how it's computed.;neutral

1411121_1;Here's another crack at this:  1) The default behavior for Derby is the current behavior with all of its security holes for java routines.;neutral
1411121_2;2) To get secure behavior for java routines, the customer has to explicitly opt-in.;neutral
1411121_3;Let's be vague about what that entails right now.;neutral
1411121_4;3) If you do opt-in, then you get the SQL standard behavior:     3a) Jar ids are mandatory.;neutral
1411121_6;Instead, to access methods in the JRE you have to include little wrapper methods in your jar files that you loaded into the database.;neutral
1411121_7;3c) The search order for customer-written routines is SQL standard: First we look in the jar file where the routine lives.;neutral
1411121_8;Then we look in the other jar files in the order specified by SQLJ.ALTER_JAVA_PATH.;neutral
1411121_9;Then we defer to the system class loader.;neutral

389675_3;In the wiki next to each one of these parameters it explicitly says that reducing this parameter will decrease memory usage, this is why we reduced these parameters (it did not mention the filterCache at all).;neutral
389675_4;They will save RAM to a certain extent for certain situations.;neutral
389675_5;But not very helpful at the sizes you are working with (and not settings I would use to save RAM anyway, unless the amount I need to save was pretty small).;neutral
389675_6;Also, the savings are largely index side - not likely a huge part of your RAM concerns, which are search side.;neutral
389675_8;My filterCache stats are great- you know it's set to 64K but right now, with almost all the RAM used up (we're at 71.9% now), but it's only using 36290 entries at the moment and it's holding pretty steady there(even as RAM usage increased by 10%).;neutral
389675_9;None of the other caches have gone up much either.;neutral
389675_10;We have no cache evictions, at all, but a 99% hit ratio.;neutral
389675_11;The sizes may be higher than you need then.;neutral
389675_12;They should be adjusted to the best settings based on the wiki info.;neutral
389675_13;I was originally suggesting you might sacrifice speed with the caches for RAM - but, its always best to use the best settings and have the necessary RAM.;neutral

1171432_2;Just really wondering/hoping you'd be interested in working on these ??;neutral

698238_1;> then we don't save IO by limiting the buffer size to 1 KB  I'm confused by this.;negative
698238_2;My assumption is that, when you make a request to read 1k from a disk file, that the OS reads substantially more than 1k from the disk and places it in the buffer cache.;neutral
698238_3;(The cost of randomly reading 1k is nearly the same as randomly reading 100k--both are dominated by seek.);neutral
698238_4;So, if you make another request to read 1k shortly thereafter you'll get it from the buffer cache and the incremental cost will be that of making a system call.;neutral
698238_5;In general, one should thus rely on the buffer cache and read-ahead, and make input buffers only big enough so that system call overhead is insignificant.;neutral
698238_6;An alternate strategy is to not trust the buffer cache and read-ahead, but rather to make your buffers large enough so that transfer time dominates seeks.;neutral
698238_7;This can require 1MB or larger buffers, so isn't always practical.;neutral
698238_8;So, back to your statement, a 1k buffer doesn't save physical i/o, but nor should it incur extra physical i/o.;neutral
698238_9;It does incur extra system calls, but uses less memory, which is a tradeoff.;neutral
